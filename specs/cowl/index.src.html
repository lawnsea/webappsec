Abstract:
  This specification defines an API for specifying privacy and
  integrity policies on data, in the form of origin labels, and a
  mechanism for confining code according to such policies.  This
  allows Web application authors and server operators to shared data
  with untrusted&mdash;buggy but not malicious&mdash;code (e.g., in a mashup
  scenario) yet impose restrictions on how the code can share the data
  further.

  In addition, this specification defines a light-weight, in-thread
  Worker.  Combined with confinement, this allows developers to build
  privilege-separated, compartmentalized applications.

<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Modern Web applications are conglomerations of JavaScript written by
  multiple authors. Authors routinely incorporate third-party scripts
  into their applications and share user data with third-party
  services (e.g., as part of a <em>mashup</em>).  Unfortunately, in
  the existing model, authors put the user's data confidentiality and
  integrity at risk when incorporating such untrusted third-party code
  or sharing data with untrusted third-party services.

  Mechanisms such as CORS and CSP can be used to mitigate these risks
  by giving authors control over whom they share data with. But, once
  data is shared, these mechanisms do not impose any restrictions on
  how the code that was "granted access" can further disseminate the
  data.

  This document specifies an extension to the current model called
  Confinement with Origin Web Labels (COWL). COWL provides authors
  with APIs for specifying access control policies on data (including
  content) in terms of <a>origin labels</a>.  These policies are
  enforced in a mandatory fashion, transitively, even once code has
  access to the data.  For example, with COWL, the author of
  <code>https://example.com/</code> can specify that a password is
  confidential to <code>https://example.com/</code> (and thus should
  only be disclosed to <code>https://example.com/</code>) before
  sharing it with a third-party password strength checking service. In
  turn, COWL ensures that the third-party service, which necessarily
  computes on the password, is confined and respects the policy on the
  password, i.e., it cannot disclose the password to any origin other
  than <code>https://example.com/</code>.

  COWL enforces such policies by confining code, at the
  <a>context</a>-level, according to the sensitivity of the data the
  code has observed. To reap the greatest benefits of COWL, authors
  will need to compartmentalize applications into multiple contexts
  (e.g., <a>iframe</a> or <a>light-weight Workers</a>). For example,
  untrusted libraries should be loaded in <a>light-weight Workers</a>
  instead of directly into a page.

  COWL is intended to be used as a defense-in-depth mechanism that can
  restrict how untrusted code handles sensitive data. To prevent
  untrusted code from accessing data in the first place, authors should
  still use discretionary access control mechanisms, such as CSP and
  CORS.


  <section>
  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The goal of COWL is to provide authors with a means for protecting
  the confidentiality and integrity of data that is shared with
  untrusted, whether third-party or their own, code.  Existing
  mechanisms (e.g., CORS and the <a>postMessage()</a> <a argument
    for="postMessage()">targetOrigin</a> argument) provide a way for
  restricting which origins may access (shared) data.  But, once
  content has access to data it can usually disseminate it without
  restrictions.  While CSP can be used to confine code, and thus
  restrict how confidential data is disseminated, setting a correct
  CSP policy (as to confine code) is difficult and limited to
  content the author has control over. Indeed, sharing confidential
  data (e.g., via cross-document messaging) implicitly requires the
  author to trust the receiver not to leak the data, accidentally or
  otherwise.  COWL provides a defense-in-depth option for
  protecting data confidentiality and integrity.  In particular,
  with COWL:

  1. Authors should be able to specify confidentiality and integrity
  policies on data in terms of origin labels: the origins to whom the
  data is confidential and the origins that endorse the data.  This
  allows authors to share sensitive data with third-party content and
  impose restrictions on the origins with which it can communicate
  once it inspects the sensitive data. Dually, it allows authors to
  share data via intermediate content while retaining its integrity.

  2. Authors should be able to run code with <em>least privilege</em>
  by restricting how the code can disseminate sensitive data.

  3. Authors should be able to <em>privilege separate</em>
  applications by loading untrusted scripts in separate
  <a>light-weight Workers</a> instead of inline <{script}> elements,
  which have the same privileges as content.

  </section>

  <section>
  <h3 id="examples">Use Cases/Examples</h3>
  <h4 id="examples-checker">Untrusted service</h4>

  An author wishes to use a service (e.g., in the form of an iframe)
  without trusting it (or its dependencies) to not leak their
  sensitive data. To protect the data, the author associates a
  <a>label</a> with the data, which encodes a security policy
  specifying the origins allowed to read the data, and shares the
  newly created <a>labeled object</a> with the untrusted code. In
  turn, COWL confines the untrusted code, once it inspects the
  sensitive data, such that it can only communicate according to the
  author-specified policy.

  <div id="example-checker" class="example">
    Consider using a third-party password strength checker provided by
    <code>https://untrusted.com</code>, loaded in the form of an
    iframe. To protect the confidentiality of the password, the
    <code>https://example.com</code> application can use COWL to
    associate a confidentiality policy, in the form of a <a>label</a>,
    with the password before sending it to the untrusted service:

    <pre><code>
    // Create new policy as a <a interface>Label</a> specifying that the password is sensitive
    // to https://example.com and should only be disclosed to this origin:
    var policy = new <a interface>Label</a>(window.location.origin);

    // Associate the label with the password:
    var labeldPassword = new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(password, {confidentiality: policy});

    // Send the labeled password to the checker iframe:
    checker.postMessage(labeledPassword, "https://untrusted.com");

    // Register listener to receive response from checker, ...
    </code></pre>

    Once the checker inspects the password, COWL limits the iframe to
    communicating with origins that preserve the password's
    confidentiality, i.e., <code>https://example.com</code>. Indeed,
    this policy is enforced mandatory, even if the
    <code>https://untrusted.com</code> service sends the password to
    yet another party.

    Note, until the checker actually inspects the protected password,
    it can communicate freely, e.g., with <code>https://untrusted.com</code>.
    This is important since the checker may need to fetch resources
    (e.g., regular expressions) to check the password strength; it is
    also safe, since it has not inspected the sensitive password.
  </div>

  This design pattern can be used to build safe password managers, for
  example, where the crypto layer and storage layer are provided by
  distrusting, but not malicious, services. Similarly, it can be used
  to implement safe encrypted document editors. The original COWL
  academic paper describes several such use cases [[COWL-OSDI]]

  <h4 id="examples-checker-worker">Untrusted library</h4>

  Rather than include a library inline using a <{script}> element, an
  author wishes to use a library without completely trusting it. The
  author can load the library in a separate iframe and use COWL to
  confine the code as shown in the previous example.  Unfortunately,
  creating many iframes is costly. (It also requires the author to
  address subtle issues, such as ensuring the iframe is of a different
  <a>origin</a>.) Hence, COWL provides <a>light-weight Workers</a> as
  a both lighter-weight and safer (since it does not have the wide
  attack surface of iframes&mdash;e.g., the DOM) constructs for
  loading scripts.

  <div class="example">

    Consider a modification to the above <a href="#example-checker">
      password-checker example</a> that uses <a>light-weight
      Workers</a> to isolate and confine the checker script. The
    author of <code>https://example.com</code> can load the script in
    an <a>unprivileged</a> Worker (ensuring it does not have the
    <a>privilege</a> to arbitrarily leak
    <code>https://example.com</code> data) and communicate with it via
    message-passing, much as in the previous example:

    <pre><code>
    // Load the checker script in an unprivileged light-weight Worker:
    var checker = new <a
    interface>LWorker</a>("https://untrusted.com/checker.js", { privilege: new <a>Privilege()</a> });

    // Register a handler, waiting for the result from the checker:
    checker.onmessage = function (event) {
      alert("Your password is: " + event.data);
    };

    // Send the checker the password, first associating a label with it:
    checker.postMessage(new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(password, 
                                          {confidentiality: new <a interface>Label</a>(window.location.origin)});
    </code></pre>
    Because all communication with Workers is done via message
    passing, the author of <code>checker.js</code> would,
    unfortunately, have to (re)write their library to the asynchronous
    model. An example is given below:
    <pre><code>
    // Fetch any data necessary to perform the computation
    onmessage = function(event) {
      // ... can still fetch data from the network

      // Get password from the <a>LabeledObject()</a>:
      var password = event.data.protectedObject;

      // ... can only communicate according to label, i.e., to https://example.com

      // Reply to parent:
      postMessage(checkStrength(password));
    };
    </code></pre>

  </div>

  <h4 id="examples-mashup">Third-party untrusted mashup</h4>

  A server operator wishes to provide third-party mashups access to
  user data. In addition to using CORS response to restrict the
  <a>origins</a> that can access the data [[!CORS]], the operator
  wishes to restrict how the data is further disseminated by these
  third-parties. To do so, the operator may send a response header
  field named <code>COWL</code> (as described in [[#response-header]])
  whose value contains the sensitivity of the data in the form of a
  (serialized) <a>label</a>.  In turn, COWL enforces the label
  restrictions on the third-party code, once it inspects the response.

  <div class="example">
  The server operator of <code>https://a.com</code> uses a CORS
  response header to "grant" <code>https://b.com</code> access to a
  resource. The operator also sets a <code>COWL</code> header to
  specify that the resource is confidential to <code>https://a.com</code>:

  <pre><code>
   <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://b.com
   <a href="#response-header">COWL</a>: confidentiality: [ ["https://a.com"] ]
  </code></pre>

  Once a <code>https://b.com</code> context read the response, COWL
  imposes the label restrictions
  (<code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>) and limits
  the code's ability to disseminate the data to
  <code>https://a.com</code>.

    <h3 id="trust-model">Trust Model</h3>
    COWL provides developers with a way of imposing restrictions on
    how untrusted code can disseminate sensitive data.  However,
    authors should not share sensitive data with malicious code, since
    such code may be able to exploit covert channels, which are present
    in most browsers, to leak the data.  COWL can only prevent
    information leakage from code that (e.g., is buggy and) uses
    overt communication channels.

    Note, COWL should be used as an additional defense layer to other
    security mechanisms such as CSP, SRI, CORS, and iframe <code><a
    element-attr>sandbox</a></code>.

  <h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts and Terminology</h2>
  <h3>Labels</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      An <dfn>origin label</dfn>, or more succinctly a
      <dfn>label</dfn>, encodes either a confidentiality or integrity
      security policy. Labels are associated with <a>contexts</a>;
      they can also be associated with <a>structurally clonable</a>
      objects.

      When associated with a <a>context</a>, the label restricts the
      origins that the context can communicate with, as detailed in
      [[#context-labels]].

      <div class="example">
       When associate with a context, the confidentiality label
       <code>
          <a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com").<a>or</a>("https://b.com")
       </code>
       restricts the context to sending data to
       <code>https://a.com</code> or <code>https://b.com</code>, but
       no other origins.
       The context label reflects the fact the context may contain data
       that is sensitive to either <code>https://a.com</code> or
       <code>https://b.com</code>; it is thus only safe for it to
       communicate <em>to</em> these origins.

       Note, because the context can communicate data to either origin,
       another context associated with the more-strict
       <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code> label cannot
       send it data. Doing so may allow for data confidential
       to <code>https://a.com</code> to be leaked to <code>https://b.com</code>.
      </div>

      When associated with an object, a confidentiality label
      specifies the origins to whom the object is sensitive, while an
      integrity label specifies the origins that endorse the object.
      [[#object-labels]] defines how labels are associated with
      objects. Objects that have labels associated with them are
      called <dfn>labeled objects</dfn>.

      <div class="example">
        Consider an <code>https://example.com</code> application that
        receives a labeled object (e.g., via <a>postMessage()</a>)
        with the following labels:

        * Confidentiality label: 
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>.
        This label indicates that the object is confidential to
        <code>https://example.com</code>.

        * Integrity label: 
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>.
        This label indicates that the object has been endorsed by
        <code>https://a.com</code>. If
        <code>https://example.com</code> received the message from
        <code>https://b.com</code>, the label reflects the fact that the
        object was not tampered by <code>https://b.com</code>.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      A label is in <dfn>normal form</dfn> if reducing it according to
      the <a>label normal form reduction</a> algorithm produces the
      same value. Mathematically, a label in <a>normal form</a>
      corresponds to a set of origins in <a>conjunction normal
        form</a> [[DCLabels]].
    </li>
    <li>
      Two labels are <dfn>equivalent</dfn> if their <a>normal form</a>
      values are equal.
    </li>
    <li>
      A label <var>A</var> <dfn>subsumes</dfn> another label
      <var>B</var> if the result of running the <a>label subsumption</a>
      algorithm on the <a>normal form</a>s of <var>A</var> and
      <var>B</var> returns <code>true</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      When reading a <a>labeled objects</a> a context gets
      <dfn>tainted</dfn> (through invocations of the <a>context
      tainting</a> algorithm) to reflect that it has read sensitive
      data and should be confined accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <dfn>current confidentiality label</dfn> is the
      confidentiality label associated with the current context.
      [[#context-labels]] specifies how labels are associated with
      contexts.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <dfn>current integrity label</dfn> is the
      integrity label associated with the current context.
      [[#context-labels]] specifies how labels are associated with
      contexts.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Privileges</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A <dfn>privilege</dfn> is an unforgeable object that corresponds
      to a <a>label</a>. Privileges are associated with contexts.

      Privileges can be used to bypass confinement restrictions
      imposed by confidentiality labels.  In particular, a privilege
      can be used to bypass the restrictions imposed by any label that
      its underlying label&mdash;the <a>internal privilege
      label</a>&mdash;subsumes.

      <div class="example">
        Consider an <code>https://a.com</code> contexts whose
        <a>current confidentiality label</a> is <code><a
            interface>Label</a>("https://a.com").and("https://b.com")</code>.
        This label confines the context to only communicating with
        entities whose labels are at least as restricting as this
        label. For example, it restricts the context from
        communicating with a context labeled <code><a
           interface>Label</a>("https://b.com")</code> context, since doing
        so would potentially leak <code>https://a.com</code> data to 
        <code>https://b.com</code>. It similarly cannot communicate with
        <code>https://a.com</code>.
        
        However, if the context's <a>current privilege</a> corresponds
        to <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>, then it
        would be able to bypass the restriction imposed by this label.
        In particular, the context would be able to communicate with
        <code>https://b.com</code>&mdash;the privilege confers the right
        to declassify <code>https://a.com</code> data to
        <code>https://b.com</code>&mdash;since the <a>effective
        confidentiality label</a> is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://b.com")</code>.
        
        Note, the context is responsible for ensuring that
        <code>http://a.com</code> data is not accidentally leaked.
        Hence, when using cross-document messaging authors should
        always use <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s.
        
        Note, the privilege cannot bypass any label restrictions. For
        example, it does not allow the context to communicate with
        <code>https://a.com</code> since doing so would potentially leak
        <code>https://b.com</code> data.
      </div>

      Privileges can also be used to bypass integrity restrictions
      imposed by integrity labels. In particular, a privilege can be
      used to endorse an otherwise untrustworthy <a>labeled
      context</a> (or <a>labeled object</a>) thereby allowing it to
      communicate with more trustworthy end-points (another context or
      server).

      <div class="example">
        Consider an <code>https://a.com</code> contexts whose
        <a>current integrity label</a> is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com").or("https://b.com")</code>.
        This label confines the context to only communicating with
        entities that are at most as trustworthy as this
        label. For example, it restricts the context from
        communicating with a context whose <a>current integrity
        label</a> is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>, since doing
        so would potentially corrupt
        <code>https://a.com</code> data&mdash;the computation was
        potentially influence by <code>https://b.com</code>.

        However, if the context's <a>current privilege</a> corresponds
        to <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://a.com")</code>, then it
        would be able to bypass the restriction imposed by this label.
        In particular, the context would be able to communicate with
        the other context since the privilege confers it the right
        to speak on behalf of <code>https://a.com</code>. Indeed, its
        <a>effective integrity label</a> is <code><a
        interface>Label</a>("https://b.com")</code>. 
  
        Note, the receiving context is responsible for ensuring
        that <code>http://b.com</code> data did not influence the
        sender's behaviour in an inadvertent way.  Hence, when using
        cross-document messaging authors should always demand the use
        <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s.
        
        Note, the privilege cannot bypass any label restrictions. For
        example, it does not allow the context to communicate with
        a context whose integrity label is
        <code><a interface>Label</a>(https://b.com</code>.
      </div>

      Note, <a>browsing contexts</a> have a <a>current privilege</a>
      that, by default, corresponds to the origin of the context, as
      described in [[#context-labels]]. Authors can set the <a>current
      privilege</a> of a context to ensure that it runs with <em>least
      privilege</em>.

    </li>
    <li>
      The <dfn>current privilege</dfn> is the privilege associated
      with the current context. [[#context-labels]] specifies how
      privileges are associated with contexts.
    </li>

    <h3 id="label">Label interface</h3>

    Each <a>label</a> is represented by a <a interface>Label</a>
    object, the interface of which is defined in this section.

    A <a interface>Label</a> MUST have an internal <dfn>label set</dfn>, which is
    a non-empty set of <a>disjunction set</a>s.

    A <dfn>disjunction set</dfn> is a set of <a>origin</a>
    <a>URL</a>s.

    A label is said to be an <dfn>empty label</dfn> if its <a>label
      set</a> contains a single, empty <a>disjunction set</a>.

    <pre class="idl">
      [Constructor, Constructor(DOMString origin)]

        boolean equals(Label other);
        boolean subsumes(Label other);

    The <dfn>combination</dfn> of privileges <var>A</var> and

    <div class="note">
      Note, the <a interface>Privilege</a> constructors and

      code must still take <a>ownership</a> of a privilege or set the
      <a>current privilege</a> to it, for the privilege to be used (to
      bypass label restrictions).
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      To be backwards-compatible with the Same-Origin Policy, COWL
      grants each <a>browsing context</a> a <a>default initial privilege</a>
      that corresponds to their origin. For example, a page on
      <code>https://example.com</code> has a privilege whose <a>internal
      privilege label</a> is
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>.

      As a result, reading data that is sensitive to
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code> does
      not confine the context. For example, reading a
      <a interface>LabeledObject</a> whose confidentiality label is
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code> does
      not restrict the context from communicating&mdash;and thus
      accidentally leak that object's contents&mdash;to another origin.
      To prevent such bugs, the author can drop the privilege by
      setting the <a>current privilege</a> to an <a>empty
      privilege</a>:
      <pre><code>
        // Save privilege in case we need it later:
        var __savedPriv = COWL.privilege;

        // Drop privilege:
        COWL.privilege = new <a>Privilege</a>();
      </code></pre>

      After this point, if the context reads data with a
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://example.com")</code>
      confidentiality label, COWL will limit it ability to communicate
      with <code>https://example.com")</code>.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Consider a modification to <a href="#example-checker">
        password-checker example</a> that uses <a>FreshPrivilege()</a>s
      to ensure that the untrusted checker cannot communicate with any
      entity other than the parent context.
      <pre><code>
        // Create new fresh privilege: 
        var priv = new <a>FreshPrivilege()</a>;

        // Take <a>ownership</a> of the fresh privilege:
        COWL.privilege = COWL.privilege.combine(priv);

        // Associate the unique label with the password:
        var labeldPassword = new <a interface>LabeledObject</a>(password, {confidentiality: priv.asLabel()});

        // Send the labeled password to the checker iframe:
        checker.postMessage(labeledPassword, "https://untrusted.com");
      </code></pre>
      Once the <code>https://untrusted.com</code> context reads the
      password is will be <a>tainted</a> by the unique, <a>internal
      privilege label</a> of <code>priv</code>; the unique origin
      ensures that it cannot send the password to, for example, public
      parts of <code>https://example.com</code>. Indeed, only the
      owner of <code>priv</code> can disseminate the labeled password
      (result) arbitrarily.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Suppose <code>https://university.edu</code> wished to isolate
      different parts of their site, for example, according to the
      users. The author can drop the privilege of a page
      <code>https://university.edu/~user1</code>:

      <pre><code lang-js>
        var uni = new <a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu");
        // Create a new label that corresponds to user1's data on university.edu:
        var user1 = uni.or("cowl://user1"); // Here the cowl:// is an arbitrary <a>scheme</a>

        // Assume: COWL.privilege.asLabel().equals(uni);
        // Drop the current context privilege to a delegated privilege:
        COWL.privilege = COWL.privilege.delegate(user1);
      </code></pre>

      At this point, the context can only arbitrarily disseminate data
      that is labeled
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu").or("cowl://user1")</code>;
      it cannot disseminate data that is
      sensitive to the university and is thus labeled
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu")</code>;
      or another user's data (e.g.,
      <code><a interface>Label</a>("https://university.edu").or("cowl://user2")</code>).

      Of course, this requires the author to properly label user data
      (e.g., when sending it to the client).

      Note, sub-domains should be used where possible to ensure
      isolation. Nevertheless, COWL's labels can serve as another
      layer of defense.

    <h3 id="context-labels">Labeled Contexts and Workers Interface</h3>

    COWL extends <a>browsing contexts</a> and <a>Workers</a> with a
    corresponding <dfn>COWL state</dfn>, which consists of:

    * The <dfn>confinement mode</dfn> status, which indicates whether
    or not COWL is enabled and thus <a>labels</a> should be enforced
    in the current context.

    * The <dfn>context confidentiality label</dfn>, which reflects
    the sensitivity of the data that the context has read, and thus
    can write to.

    * The <dfn>context integrity label</dfn>, which reflects the
    integrity of the data that the context has read, and thus can
    write to.

    * The <dfn>context privilege</dfn>, which encodes the context's
    ability to bypass restrictions of certain labels.

    Each <a>browsing context</a>'s and <a>Worker</a>'s <dfn>COWL
    state</dfn> MUST be initially set to the <dfn>default COWL
    state</dfn>, where:

    * The <a>confinement mode</a> is disabled.

    * The <a>context confidentiality label</a> is set to the
    <dfn>default confidentiality label</dfn>: an <a>empty label</a>.

    * The <a>context integrity label</a> is set to the
    <dfn>default integrity label</dfn>: an <a>empty label</a>.

    * The <a>context privilege</a> is set to the
    <dfn>default privilege</dfn>: a
    <a>privilege</a> whose <a>internal privilege label</a> is
    equivalent to <a>Label(<var>origin</var>)</a></code>, where
    <var>origin</var> is the string representation of the context or
    Worker's <a>origin</a>.

    <div class="note">
      To be backwards-compatible with the Same-Origin Policy the
      <a>default COWL state</a> is very relaxed. Specifically:
      
      * Unless <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled, a context is not
      subject to label restrictions. (Of course, algorithms such as the
      <a>context tainting</a> algorithm implicitly enable confinement
      mode.)

      * Unless the <a>current confidentiality</a> label is
      set&mdash;explicitly or implicitly via the <a>context tainting</a>
      algorithm&mdash;to a non-<a>empty label</a>, it can communicate to
      any context, server or Worker; code is only subject to the
      restrictions imposed by other mechanism such as the Same-Origin
      Policy, CSP, and CORS.

      * Unless the <a>current privilege</a> is adjusted, even when
      <a>confinement mode</a> is enabled, code can accidentally leak
      data sensitive to the context's <a>origin</a>. Such data is
      implicitly declassified using the <a>context privilege</a>.
      Authors should always send <a>LabeledObjects()</a> to explicitly
      communicate the sensitivity (and integrity) of the data they are
      sharing.
       
      ISSUE: for discussion: should privileges be used explicitly

    A <a interface>LabeledObject</a> MUST have an internal <dfn>protected

      When invoking the <a>LabeledObject()</a> constructor, the user
      agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to the following:

      argument, if it is set.  Otherwise, let <var>conf</var> be
      the <a>current confidentiality label</a>.

      3. Let <var>int</var> be the <a dict-member
      for="CILabel">integrity</a> member of the <a argument
      for="LabeledObject/LabeledObject(obj, labels)">labels</a>
      parameter, if it is set.  Otherwise, let <var>int</var> be the
      <a>current integrity label</a>.

      4. Let <var>canWrite</var> be the result of invoking the <a>write
      check</a> algorithm with the <var>conf</var> and <var>int</var> labels.

      5. If <var>canWrite</var> is <code>false</code>, the constructor
      MUST throw a <a spec="HTML5">SecurityError</a> exception
      and terminate this algorithm.

      6. Else, the constructor MUST return a new
      <a interface>LabeledObject</a>, with the <a>protected object</a>
      set to <var>obj clone</var>, the confidentiality label set to
      <var>conf</var>, and the integrity
      label set to <var>int</var>.
      </dd>

    <div class="note">
      Because COWL enforces labels at context boundaries, there is
      usually no reason to label an object and then use the labeled
      object within the same context.  <a interface>LabeledObject</a>s
      are mainly useful for sending sensitive data to an untrusted
      context, e.g., via cross-document messaging, as a way to ensure
      that the data's confidentiality and integrity (as specified by
      the labels) are respected by the untrusted context. Hence, the
      <a>LabeledObject()</a> constructor only accepts objects that can
      be <a>structurally cloned</a>.

      <dt><dfn attribute title="LabeledObject/protectedObject">protectedObject</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        On getting, the user agent MUST use an algorithm equivalent to
        the following:

        1. Invoke the <a>context tainting</a> algorithm with the <a
        interface>LabeledObject</a>'s confidentiality and integrity labels.
        
        2. If the <a>context tainting</a> algorithm raises an
        exception, rethrow the exception and terminate this algorithm.

        3. Return the <a interface>LabeledObject</a>'s <a>protected
        object</a>.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="note">
      Note: the labels of a <a interface>LabeledObject</a> are
      essentially public: code can always inspect labels. However, to
      inspect the internal, <a>protected object</a> the current
      context must be tainted according to the object's labels. This
      ensures two things:

      * The context can't violate the confidentiality of the data (as
      specified by the confidentiality label) by communicating
      arbitrarily once it reads data labeled as such.

      * The context can't violate the integrity of entities more
      trustworthy than the data. (The trustworthiness of the data is
      specified by the integrity label.) In particular, once the
      context reads the data and gets tainted, the rest of the
      computation is restricted to writing to entities that are at
      most as trustworthy as the data, for the read data may have
      influenced the computation.
